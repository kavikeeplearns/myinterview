Compile the source codes in following sequence

1) Compile REGF.PF file
2) Compile REGDSPFIL.DSPF file
3) Compile REGDSPPGM.RPGLE pgm
4) Compile REGEX.C pgm
5) Compile REGCPGM.CLLE pgm
6) Compile REGEXCMD.CMD command

The application can be invoked by any of following methods

a) REGEXCMD DIR(<expected directory name say /, /etc/, /home/tester, etc.,>)  
         FILTYPE(file extension say c,py,tiff,pdf)           
         FILPATT(patter,like hello)

Note: In this method, the values passed by reference to processing CL has 
attribute type prefixed in my test machine. It may work on your AS400 machine.

b) CALL PGM(QTEMP/REGCPGM)                       
     PARM(('/home/Tester') ('c') ('hello'))   
     
c) In both methods, you would get a display screen listing all the matching patterns. 
Pressing F3 on this screen will take you out of the tool. Considering, real world
scenarios, there could by more than 9999 files in those cases we may need single page
or elastic subfiles. For this case, I used load all subfile.
